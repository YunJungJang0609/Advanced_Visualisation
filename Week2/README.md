Materials:
Phones with cameras
3x3 chess board
9 cylinder tokens
1 square basket

Players: minimum 3 (1 host and 2 even teams).

Goal: place 3 tokens in a row.

Actions: win hidden tokens by finding them and getting them into the basket.

Turn:
The teams close their eyes.
The host silently hides a token anywhere in the space and takes a picture of the basket from this point in space.
The host zooms into the picture so that only the basket appears, and comes back to the teams silently.
The teams can open their eyes, look at the picture, and try to find the hidden token.
Whenever someone finds the token, all players freeze.
Without moving their legs, the players can pass the token to their team members or attempt to throw it directly into the basket.
If a team manages to get the token in the basket, they win the token.
If the token falls on the ground or another surface, the token is lost and a new turn begins.
When a team wins a token, they can place it on the grid.

End condition: the first team to get 3 tokens in a row on the grid wins the game.
